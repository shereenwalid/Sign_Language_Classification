# Sign Language Classification 
## Motivation
Regardless of the widespread usage of spoken languages, the value of American Sign Language (ASL) in fostering diversity, eliminating communication obstacles, and fostering an inclusive society cannot be underestimated. In the United States alone, there are between 500,000 and two million people who use American Sign Language (ASL).                
It ranks sixth in terms of usage in the US, after Spanish, Italian, German, and French


## Tools

1. PyTorch: PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework that provides a flexible and efficient way to build deep learning models. It allows you to easily create, train, and deploy neural networks for various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and natural language processing.        

2. Torchvision: Torchvision is a PyTorch package that provides popular datasets, model architectures, and image transformations for computer vision tasks. It includes pre-trained models like ResNet, VGG, and AlexNet, along with utility functions for data loading and image processing.       

3. PIL (Python Imaging Library): PIL is a library for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. It provides a convenient interface for performing operations such as resizing, cropping, and rotating images.          

4. IBM Watson TextToSpeechV1: IBM Watson TextToSpeechV1 is a service provided by IBM Watson that converts written text into natural-sounding speech. It can be used to generate audio files from text, which can be useful for applications such as voice assistants, audiobooks, and accessibility tools.          

5. IBM Cloud SDK: The IBM Cloud SDK is a set of tools and libraries that enable developers to interact with IBM Cloud services. It provides a convenient way to authenticate with IBM Cloud services, make API calls, and manage resources.
